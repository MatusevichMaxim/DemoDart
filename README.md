# Step-by-Step TDD Instructions: Creating a Simple Flutter Application
In this example, we'll develop a simple counter application using the Test-Driven Development approach. 
Follow the steps below - each includes:
- üõ† Define what needs to be done. If necessary, break down complex tasks into smaller ones
- üî¥ Write a "red" test for an elementary task
- ‚úÖ Implement the functionality (the test should become "green")
- ‚ôªÔ∏è (optional) Refactoring

PS. For testing navigation, I used functional UI tests, which isn't the best solution. It's better to test the screen type directly, and if necessary, test and document the widget UI itself through [Snapshot tests][snt].
